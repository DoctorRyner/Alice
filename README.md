Ksenia Erulevich, designer of Alice typeface,
was inspired by Lewis Carroll's novel and
decided to make a typeface that will
be suitable for typesetting this book.

It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, 
having widened proportions, open aperture, and 
soft rounded features. Perfect for long meditative text-setting and headlines.

This is in fact Ksenia's first typeface, as part of 
her diploma project at the Type & Typography course in Moscow, Russia.

Released by Cyreal with help from Gayaneh Bagdasaryan and Alexei Vanyashin.
